Material Kit is a Free Bootstrap 5 UI Kit with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's material design. You asked for it, so we built it. It's a great pleasure to introduce to you the material concepts in an easy to use and beautiful set of components. Along with the restyling of the Bootstrap elements, you will find three fully-coded example pages, to help you design your next project.

Material Kit makes use of light, surface, and movement. It uses a deliberate color choice, edge-to-edge imagery, and large scale typography. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers so that the depth and order are obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left and the actions on the right.

This new design has elements that have been the result of research regarding ink and paper and the way objects and materials interact in real life. The result is a beautiful and consistent set of elements that can get you started with your next project. Material Kit is a great tool if you are looking to create a web presence for your Android application and need to be consistent, leaving the impression of visually similar elements. It is also a great resource in its own right, looking gorgeous and helping you build your web pages.

Backend logic provided by genezio
genezio is a platform that allows developers to write, deploy, and use serverless APIs with ease. With genezio, developers can write their backend logic in classes and design their frontend using their preferred programming language.

Once the backend classes are written, genezio deploys them onto a serverless infrastructure. The platform generates an SDK that developers can use to remotely call the methods of their class in a very natural way, making it easy to call backend logic from the client.

The platform comes with a handful of examples to start from, and developers can integrate it into their CI/CD pipeline with a dedicated GitHub action.

Most complex and innovative UI Kit Made by [Creative Tim](https://creative-tim.com/). Check our latest Free Bootstrap 5 UI Kit.

Designed for those who like bold elements and beautiful websites. Made of hundred of elements, designed blocks and fully coded pages, Material Kit 2 is ready to help you create stunning websites and webapps.

We created many examples for pages like Sign In, Contact US and so on. Just choose between a Basic Design, an illustration or a cover and you are good to go!

**Fully Coded Elements**

Material Kit 2 is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, navtabs, cards or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented.
This Free Bootstrap 5 UI Kit is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless,
switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

**Documentation built by Developers**

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation.
